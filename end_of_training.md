# End of Training
There are 2 important events that take place during the end of training; the Language Proficiency Interview (LPI) and the swear in ceremony. I decided to lump them into one post because they occured within 2 days of each other.

The LPI is a conversational exam where the examiner and the tester have a recorded conversation in the learned language. Peace Corps Trainees have to achieve an intermediate mid score in order to be able to go to their assigned community. If not, they'll have to stay behind and re-take the exam. It rarely happens, but if a trainee continuously fails, I think they get sent back to America. For me, I had a conversation in Dagbani talking about myself, my family, and my daily routine, as well as having to role play bargaining at a market. Thankfully, I was able to achieve an intermediate mid score.

2 days after exam day, we had our [swear in ceremony](https://web.facebook.com/USEmbassyGhana/videos/1047661110011275)! After 3 months of integrating into a new culture, learning a new language, and practicing teaching, we were finally sworn in as Peace Corp Volunteers at the US ambassador's residence. Many Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs) attended the swear in ceremony to support us. Most now work for USAID or the US embassy. It was also nice to meet Virginia Palmer, the US ambassador and a fellow Hoo.

## Thoughts

#### LPI
I don't want to bore you, so fair warning that this section will be mostly me complaining about how I suck at learning a new language. You're still here? Ok, well I suck at learning a new language. I took Spanish for 5 years during middle and high school and when I visited Mexico recently, the only thing I remembered was "hola". I don't know why, but I retain new information really well... unless it's language.

The subject material wasn't the only thing difficult for my incompetent language learning portion of my brain. The new environment and schedule we were on made me both physically and mentally tired. Throughout my education, I would have enough energy to open up my backpack and do some individual studying after classes, but whenever I came home from training, I only wanted to relax. You can revisit my [Homestay Daily Routine](homestay_daily_routine.md) to get a sense of why I was so tired by 6PM.

About a week before the LPI, I started putting 1,000% more effort in studying than the previous 3 months of training. In other words, I put in an hour of work before I slept every night. But, that was all I could do because I would fall asleep in my chair otherwise. Luckily, that was enough to squeak past the exam. I really didn't want to stay another week studying while everybody else in my cohort went to their sites.

Even though language was hard, I had a really awesome language teacher named Fuseini (Fuzzy). He really cared about how we were fairing mentally and physically throughout PST. Additionally, he allowed us to schedule 1-1 tutoring sessions at any time to get more practice. He joked around a lot and he did his job well. All three of us Dagbani learners successfully passed the LPI.

#### Swearing-in Ceremony
I'd say Peace Corps training is either the 1st or 2nd most mentally and physically taxing thing I've done in my life. It's right up there with running a marathon. In full transparency, there were a couple of times where I questioned if I made the right decision to spend 2 years here. Those thoughts wiggled their way into my head whenever I became sick. After getting sick 3 separate times, I can confirm that sick days here are 5x worse than in the States. Even though the entirety of PST was extremely challenging, I'm glad I was able to persevere. That's why the ceremony was such a big deal. I had survived. I'm also proud to be part of the [Abonse Hilltoppers](/cohort_spotlight.md), our cohort's name. We all successfully completed training and swore in as volunteers.

It was a great day because I was able to celebrate with my cohort, my teachers, and Returned Peace Corps Volunteers. Also, the AC in the Peace Corps bus and ambassador's residence was very refreshing. Plus, she had finger foods that I definitely took full advantage of. I don't even like cinnamon rolls, but I ate 3 because I missed American food.

The entirety of the swearing-in ceremony was only half the day. The other half was a celebration with our homestay families! Even though it was cool to travel to Accra, officially swear in, meet the ambassador, and get nice pictures, I enjoyed the celebration with our homestay families more. It felt more meaningful. They were the one's that fed us everyday, gave us housing, and were our cultural teachers. I'll make a short post about the Abonse celebration later.
