# Homestay Daily Routine
I'd like to think I'm a more flexible person than most, I mean you have to be to join the Peace Corps, but I always appreciate a fixed routine. Back at home, my schedule was extremely predictable, ask any of my Strava followers.

In Pre-Service Training (PST), it's hard to make a consistent routine since so many schedule changes occur, but I've tried my best to stick to one. When you look at each individual activity in itself, it's drastically different than what I did in America. But, if you categorize the activities, they're somewhat similar. Let me explain. For daily exercise in America, I lifted or ran. Here in Ghana, I sweep and fetch water. Both are done first thing in the morning and both leave me physically exhausted.
