# Practicum
Peace Corps Ghana practicum is 2 weeks of in field training. Ghana accepts 3 types of volunteers: agriculture, health, and education. I'm not entirely sure what the 2 weeks of in field training looks like for the agriculture and health volunteers, but us education volunteers go to a local Ghanian school and teach Math and Science for 2 weeks. We prepare lesson plans, observe other teachers's lessons, interact with students, and see how Ghanian Schools are run.

If we were to section off American education before university, we'd have pre-school (1 year), elementary school (6 years), middle school (2 years), and high school (4 years). Likewise, Ghanian education before univeristy is broken into 4 sections which are kindergarten (2 years), basic school (6 years), junior high school (3 years), and senior high school (3 years). As a Peace Corps volutneer, I'll be teaching junior high school forms 1 and 2 (and maybe 3).

## Thoughts
I have a lot of experience tutoring, but not much in teaching. The closest thing I've done is run computer science labs or exam reviews in college, but those were with older, more mature students and I didn't have to plan out any lessons. Even though I used to get scared when talking in front of a group, I felt practicum was a breeze. I remembered all the math concepts, however I have to admit, I had to review a lot of the science concepts before teaching.

The difficulty wasn't in lesson planning, it was dealing with a large amount of teenage students. My classes had around 50 students packed in one room. Some liked to act up, some were non-stop talking, and some slept since they all have physically demanding chores every morning. I mean I nap all the time during the Peace Corps sessions too, so I can relate. Anyways, it was all good practice, since I'll be teaching in a school with 70 students per class when I'm at my permanent site.

One thing I noticed that was very different than the US curriculum is that students go through nearly all the same topics every single year in junior high school, just going more in depth as they progress in their education. For example, I only took Biology once in high school. In the Ghanaian curriculum, students would learn Biology for all 3 years, and lessons would get more complex as they advance through the grades.

*Once a week, the students gather for worship. Kordiabe is a Catholic school, so a local preist comes to give a little service. There are also 2 nuns from India that work at the school.*

*The school is understaffed, so the kindergarten kids get a lot of breaks. Here is me trying to play catch with them.*

*When it rains in Ghana, nobody teachs. Kordiabe has no lights and the roofs are metal sheets, so it's both extremely dark and loud when it rains. Here is me trying to teach while it's raining. I ended up just re-teaching the entire lesson the next day.*
