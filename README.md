## About Me

![profile](/images/profile.JPG)

My name is Nathan, and I'm currently a Peace Corps Volunteer. I grew up in Virginia near Washington, D.C., and have lived in Virginia all my life, so moving and living in Ghana has been a big change. Before joining the Peace Corps, I was a software engineer for 2.5 years. I've always enjoyed tutoring others and hope my experience translates well into teaching in a Ghanian classroom.

## Description
This page will mostly contain pictures, short stories, and what I was feeling at the time. Let me know if you want me to write about a specific way of life in Ghana.
