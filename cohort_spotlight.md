### Bruce Bayly

1. Before I joined Peace Corps I was a math professor at the University of Arizona.

2. I have a lot of favorite memories so far! One highlight was Cooking Day, going to market in morning then cooking and eating all the different things the other groups made.

3. Toughest challenge so far was getting in habit of ironing my shirt before going to school in the mornings!

4. One story that was funny to me was coming back from University of Ghana with Nathan and Conal. We had to change trotros at a stop along the way (Madina?). Some kid told Nathan "Follow me!", So Nathan followed him, and Conal followed Nathan and I followed Conal, wondering if we would ever find our way out of this crazy network of alleys and vendor stalls. But everything worked out! The kid found us a trotro, and we got on, and the trotros took us right to the Hephzibah Christian Center where we were staying. I was very relieved üôÇ!

### Dylan Denner

1. I had dropped out of graduate school to become the general manager of a baseball & softball academy. I was there only a year before leaving for Peace Corps again. 

2. Ahhhh, favorite memory is so tough because I know they‚Äôll all be my favorites. One memory that really sticks out to me is our Swearing-In celebration in Dodowa. I think I was just really taken back by the fact that all of these people were so instrumental in making our PST what it was. Every cohorts PST is unique and being the first in Abonse, and knowing that all of these people will most likely never all be together again‚Ä¶ that was a really special moment for me that I‚Äôm happy I took a few extra moments to appreciate. 

3. Toughest challenge so far‚Ä¶ ya know, for me it‚Äôs this feeling of constantly walking an imaginary tightrope with wanting to be helpful to other PCVs while also acknowledging people don‚Äôt always want advice nor is what I have to safe helpful by any means. Sure, parts of PC are hard and integrating into a community is scary don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Ä¶ but I think I‚Äôve done a pretty good job of realizing the ‚Äúscary shadow of a monster on the wall‚Äù is often just me in my own head playing with a flashlight and making different shapes with my hand. 

4. Funny PC story‚Ä¶ oh there are so so many!! I don‚Äôt know how to pick just one‚Ä¶ okay! So there was a day in Abonse where there was a traditional celebration for the installment of a new traditional leader. As a part of the celebration, there were these ‚Äúcannons‚Äù that were like welded pipes that blasted out just hot air from a chemical reaction. After our morning training sessions, Kevin and I were walking back to my homestay house and bumped into a guy with one of the cannons. Naturally, we asked if we could blow it off. The dude was real cool and was super nice about explaining the whole thing to us. I took my phone out to record and Kevin was tasked with actually igniting it. During the process, the guy said that the cannon wasn‚Äôt going to go off well due to to much water being added plus we couldn‚Äôt get the matches to ignite it‚Ä¶ so it seemed like we were out of luck but it was cool to try nonetheless. The guy took the matches from Kevin for one last try and as soon as I put the lit match near the bottom hole the cannon blew off so freaking loud we all almost sh*t ourselves. I got it on video and it never fails to make me laugh

### Tyler DeShaw

![tyler](/images/cohort_spotlight/tyler.png)

1. I was a high school English teacher at the Washington School for the Deaf for ten years.

2. My favorite memory so far was observing the enstoolment of a sub chief and two queen mothers in our homestay village. Seeing years of tradition and customs in action was amazing.

3. The toughest challenge for me definitely is being patient. Time moves differently here than what I am used in the US so I need to tell myself to be patient and understanding. Communication breakdowns occur frequently and as a Deaf person, such happenings can be very frustrating. However, when I shift my perspective and practice patience, I begin to see things happen for a reason and I just have to go with the flow.

4. Much like how we Americans have a limited point-of-view on life in Ghana, locals here have assumptions about us. It is always funny when I tell my students and fellow teachers that I am able to cook for myself because of their reactions which can range from being shocked to in disbelief. Also, when I spell out Twi words, the school nurse actually took a few steps back into the wall in surprise because she assumed I wouldn't be able to communicate in the local language.

### Kevin Eberle

![kevin](/images/cohort_spotlight/kevin.png)

1. Before Peace Corps, I was an engineer at Honda designing steering systems. My first designs were actually just released in the 2023 Honda Pilot.

2. My favorite memory so far was getting to experience the Fire Fest. Fire Fest is a super important festival in the Northern Region and getting to participate in it on my first day in my community was an amazing way to be introduced into the culture and the people of Zugu.

3. So far the toughest challenge has been getting used to the different perspectives on privacy. In my community, everyone is very open at all times. So it's very normal for people to randomly walk in to other's houses throughout the day just to hang out. Naturally with me being the new and different person, kids are constantly coming in to my house to say hi, meaning I have very little time to myself. With me being an introvert, it's been a struggle figuring out how to set sustainable boundaries for myself while also trying to integrate into this culture.

4. As context, my doors swing open without any resistance. So if you're running, you can run straight through my door and it'll swing open, unless it's locked. Well the kids that live around me have figured this out and will run straight through my door at all hours of the day, excited to say hi. As I've been trying to set boundaries for when it's OK to visit and when its not OK, I've been locking my door in the mornings and evenings when I don't want visitors. This caught the kids a bit by surprise as they will run full speed at the door fully expecting it to swing right open, only to slam into a locked door. To this day, I still occasionally am woken up to a loud bang as a small child bounces off my locked door.

### Shane√© Galloway

![shanee](/images/cohort_spotlight/shanee.png)

1. I was teaching in a self-contained classroom for students with moderate to severe disabilities for DoDEA.

2. My favorite memory (gosh, there are so many!) Might have to be teaching my students to Electric Slide with an Afrobeat twist and realizing that I'm in Ghana, residing at a school for the Deaf and finally living out a dream that is over 15 years in the making.

3. My toughest challenge was either walking up the  hills in Abonse while trying to talk to people along the way ü•µ or switching from learning Twi to learning Dagbani once I learned that my site was up North, lol!

4. "Haha," funny or "ironic" funny? I hope no one else used this one but: During PST, we were being exposed to traveling via public transportation. My group of four was assigned Independence Square in Accra. The journey started off fine. We made it about halfway and needed to switch vehicles. One of my groupmates asked that we be taken to our next stop, which was Tema Station. It was taking longer than I had expected because we shouldn't have been far from our final stop. I checked Google maps and saw that we were about 10 minutes from Tema...the city, NOT Tema Station in Accra ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI explained our situation to the Tro driver, who was very nice, and he took us to a taxi and explained where we needed to go and we were on our way. We all had a good laugh for weeks to come!

### Sam Herndon and Dryana Russel

![sam and dryana](/images/cohort_spotlight/sam_and_dryana.png)

1. I was in my undergrad for material science and engineering and Sam had just graduated a couple of months before and was working for a failure analysis company.

2. Shia Hills is probably the favorite 

3. Toughest part has probably been our housing arrangement at site

4. I have walked into a soccerbet place and asked where I could buy a soccer ball

### Conal Thie

1. Engineer at a semi-conductor company 

2. Playing games with the children in my host family 

3. The 14.5 hour bus ride from Tamale to Accra 

4. During homestay, when I would return home from training, the 3 children in my homestay family would race to me, wanting to carry my backpack. The ones that I didn't give my backpack to would start fighting to take it. So, I began carrying other items in my hands just to give them to them to carry, and they remained peaceful

### Gaelle Vincent

![gaelle](/images/cohort_spotlight/gaelle.png)

1. Before joining the Peace Corps, I worked in schools as a teacher‚Äôs assistant and a paraprofessional. Right college in 2020, I joined an Americorp program called CityYear Boston. That school year, I worked virtually tutoring 10th grade math students and assisting the classroom teacher with classroom management and student support. It was a hectic and strange year working virtually but so rewarding as well. I stayed with the program for a second year, and my role changed to a more managerial position. Where I supported new volunteers and focused more on supporting the school community. After my second year, I did some miscellaneous work before becoming a 1-1 paraprofessional and worked in a PACE classroom. I was in this position for a short time before my Peace Corps journey began, but it only solidified my joy of supporting students.

2. There are many small highlights, especially those with a tinge of delirium from our long days. Our cohort is quite a silly bunch and trying to stay light hearted was essential to push through our training. From interpretive dances of ‚ÄúHey There Delilah‚Äù, impromptu dance sessions, and competitive card games. A memory that left an impression on me was a night of light rain with my host family. Under an orange tree where a family plucks the palm nut fruit, a headlight illuminates the fruit. The cool breeze blew, and the stars twinkled in the sky. Birds sang from the deep forest and friendly critters scurry about. I joined them under the tree and we shared pleasantries. My honest family were discussing their second eldest and asked me if she had tried to talk to me in english. I told them she has tried and I appreciate the effort. They tease her a bit and a mixture of Twi and English flows between us with bolts of laughter. I remember feeling truly integrated with my host family that night.

3. The toughest challenge for me is trying not to agonize about the future. Our post service training gave us a glimpse of what to expect but not the full picture. After visiting our sites and now fully settling into our communities, the individual challenges are more apparent. For my site, it‚Äôs the need of teachers in the JHS(Junior High School). There is currently one and once I begin teaching there will be two teachers in the JHS. This isn‚Äôt a special case but a norm that many schools in Ghana are tackling. Though it doesn‚Äôt lessen the daunting reality. Sometimes I spend too long contemplating: will I/can I help my community substantially or do I have the tools and background to support my students. It‚Äôs a perspective that is detrimental to my service and self-centered but ultimately rooted in the desire to be an effective asset to our communities.

4. During our first week in Ghana, we were sent in groups to explore Accra and use the local transportation system on our own. We were told the general directions on how to get to our locations we needed to explore. From our hotel, catching a trotro took us 2 attempts and then we made our way to Madina Station. I was tasked with finding our next trotro to Tema station. As we walked around, and mates shouted their destination beckoning you to join their cars. People are bustling around and as the several mates ask where we are going, I tell them ‚ÄúTema Station, Tema Station‚Äù. Directing us to a car. Once the trotro was full, we began our journey occasionally monitoring our saved google maps. At a certain point, Shane√©( a volunteer sitting with me in the front) noticed we had passed Independent Square and told the mate and driver where we were trying to go. Turns out there is a town called Tema outside of Accra and a station in Accra called Tema Station. We were headed to the town. An unexpected detour, but Shane√© has traveled to Ghana before and was a former girl scout. She was prepared for moments like these. We found a taxi that could take us to Independence Square and were able to make it back to our hotel with the extra cedi(Ghanaian currency) Shane√© had from her previous visit to Ghana. Every now and again we laugh and they tease me about our trip, but it was definitely one to remember.

1. What were you doing before joining the Peace Corps?
I was wrapping up a 43+ year career as a research engineer, the last 33 years of which were spent at 3M, where I was closely involved with the development of the world's first N95 respirators, among other things.

2. What is your favorite memory so far?
People are surprised and happy when I speak to them in Twi (their local language); some have been shocked.  On more than one occasion I've seen people sit up and pay close attention because they never expected that from a foreigner.  In the same vein, when I tell people (in Twi) that I'll be living and working in their community for two years they stop me and repeat (in English) with a sense of disbelief, "Two years?".  I suppose they want to make sure that I knew what I was saying and they understood what I was saying through my thick accent.  In any event, when I confirm that yes, I'll be here for two years, they express appreciation and admiration for my commitment to their community.

3. What was your toughest challenge so far?
Food.  As much as I pride myself on being open to new foods, I'm afraid that Ghanaian food doesn't do much for me.  I'll eat something that's offered, but I don't have any motivation to learn how to cook it.  I'm happy to cook for myself, but there's the challenge of finding the ingredients that I need for the dishes I want to prepare (Mexican, Italian, Chinese, ...).  In some cases, those ingredients (e.g., olive oil) are expensive by Ghanaian standards, so I'm wrestling with finding acceptable substitutes that are within a PCV's budget.

4. Tell us a funny Peace Corps story.
According to the training and literature we received from PC, PCVs should strive to be well known and respected in their community.  The "well known" part is all about integration - get out, meet people, introduce yourself so that your community knows who you are and why you're here.  The "respected" part has to do with the roles that PCVs fill in their communities.  For example, we're told that teachers are held in high regard, so we should not do anything that would reflect poorly on Peace Corps or the position of respect and trust that has been bestowed upon us by our communities.  Consequently, we're told that teachers don't hang out in bars drinking.  If we want to enjoy an occasional beer then we should make a discreet purchase, take it home, and enjoy it there.  After a challenging week walking around my community, greeting people, and visiting with anyone/everyone who was willing to put up with my lousy language skills, I decided that I had earned a beer.  On the advice of a fellow teacher, I followed him to a "spot" in the center of town to make my purchase.  As I approached the spot, the happy voice of the proprietor, whom I'd never met, boomed out a greeting, "Teacher Kwadwo!" (the name by which I'm known in my community).  I guess I got an "A" for integration and a "C" for discretion.  So it goes.
