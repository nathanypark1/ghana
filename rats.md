# Rats
The Northern region of Ghana experiences 1 rainy season and 1 dry season (November-May). During the dry season, a lot more bushmeat becomes available for consumption because the landscape becomes dry and bare. Farm boys will go to the bush and hunt for anything that's moving. Many times, they will light a fire to scare the animals out of hiding. Bush burning is detrimental to the soil's health, but the possibility to eat some good protein outweighs the cost to these farm boys.

## Thoughts
Before coming to Ghana, my taste palette had been exposed to many different sea foods, but lacked many land animals. That all changed one day when Hizikil, Conal, and I were enjoying the weekend off. Hizikil suggested he take us to see the irrigation farms since we hadn't  visited yet. While we were checking out the farms, we found some farm boys with a good haul of rats. Hizikil bargained and eventually bought them.

I think this was the most nervous I'd been before eating something. I'd rank rats a step above the moving squid Korean's like to eat. I remember I bought some flavored soda to wash them down if they tasted horrible and listened to hype music before the first bite. Thankfully, Conal was there with me, and I felt a bit of peer pressure because he was going to give them a try. Anyways, they tasted pretty good as any deep-fried thing would. Enjoy the farm to table journey of rats!

*Making sure any of the fur missed gets burned off. Maybe there is a health benefit of burning the skin before cooking them too.*

*Taking out all the parts you don't want to eat. The nearby chickens loved the guts.*

*First, we boiled with onions, garlic, and salt.*

*Next, we deep fried them.*
