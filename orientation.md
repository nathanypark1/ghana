# Staging
Staging, or pre-departure, is a day-long orientation held in the states to prepare us for making a good first impression with the Peace Corps Ghana staff.

## Thoughts
Usually, Staging (orientation) is held in Washington, D.C., and Peace Corps Ghana cohorts fly out of Dulles. But I was disappointed when I figured out I'd have to go to Philadelphia for staging and fly out of JFK. On the bright side, I've never been to Philly and was excited to see some of the historic sites with my few hours of free time.

The night before leaving for Philly, I stayed at Henna nunna and Yama's house. I'm super grateful that they fed, housed, and drove me to Union Station. I'm not a very emotional person, and I wasn't then, but looking back at it now, it's a bittersweet memory. It was a series of lasts. The last time I'd eat with family. The last time I'd hug my family. The last time I'd see family. I mean, it's not the very last time, but it'll be the longest time I've ever been away from family.

Travel to Philly was short and easy. I had about 2 hours to spare at the hotel before the first Staging session, so I decided I needed to see the most historic site in Philly. I quickly changed into my running outfit and had a nice jog to the Rocky steps. Early the next morning, I was able to visit the less important sites like Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell before an entire day of sessions.

After the last session, we quickly boarded the bus to JFK, checked in our bags, ate some Buffalo Wild Wings, and boarded the plane.
