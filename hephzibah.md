# Hephzibah
After we arrived in Ghana, we stayed at Hephzibah Hotel for 10 days. Hephzibah is about 1.5 hours away from the airport and was a comfortable place for us to familiarize ourselves with each other, strengthen our stomachs with Ghanaian food, and get accustomed to our packed training schedule.

## Thoughts
Peace Corps Ghana is the longest running Peace Corps post, and it shows. They have everything planned out. They identify potential issues before they occur and actively take preventative measures. It's great they scheduled a 10-day-long hotel stay because I personally needed it to get used to the food, toilets, heat, daylight schedule, etc. I thought I had a strong stomach, but I guess it's not strong enough. It also had all the amenities like running water, air conditioning, Wi-Fi, and room cleaning. I have to say, I miss AC the most.

The days at Hephzibah were great. We had three meals a day, with an additional snack time in between. I was eating new foods every meal and trying all these different types of spices I'd never tasted before. Every time we would drive somewhere, I would look at everything and trying to take it all in. My cohort is from all over America, and we had a lot of fun getting to know each other. It almost felt like college orientation again, except we were older in age, and we all ended up getting along with each other. Everything was so comfortable, but that would all change when we went to homestay. That's when I experienced culture shock.

For those 10 days, we had a lot of sessions on safety and security, the Ghanaian education system, language and culture, and health and medicine. I can't promise I was able to stay awake for all of them. But sometimes sleeping is more important than learning about malaria prevention. Just kidding, I stayed awake for that one. Especially because we had to practice taking a malaria test, which involved pricking your own finger. Just the thought of cutting my finger and drawing blood makes me stressed. All in all, the sessions were informative and mostly enjoyable.
