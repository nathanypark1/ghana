# Site Visit
Around the 2 month point in training, we finally found out our permanent sites and visited for 5 days. It was a small amount of time in a brand new place, but we tried to make the most of it. Peace Corps gave us some integration assignments such as visiting major landmarks in the community, visiting the school, meeting our colleagues, noting any problems with the housing, and practicing language.

## Thoughts
For me, site visit was quite challenging. I think I have a relatively high threshold on what stresses me out. However, during site visit, one issue definitely crossed that threshold.

I'm able to fetch water on 2 consecutive days a week at my site, Thursday and Friday. That means I need to fetch enough water on Friday to last me to the following Thursday. The only problem was that I had no water barrel when I arrived at site; I only had a mattress and two buckets. In Ghana it's normalized and encouraged that you bath twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. I think it's because it's so dusty here that it's good to clean out your pores for health reasons. Adding to my water use, I have a bucket flush toilet, which takes 1 full bucket per flush. For the math people out there, I'd need a minimum of 4 buckets if I were to bath twice a day and go poop twice a day. Remember, I only had 2 full buckets.

Some of the stress was eased when I was given a small water container that gave me an additional 2.5 buckets to store. But, I didn't feel comfortable until I was able to go to the school and borrow their [veronica bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_bucket) for my stay. Luckily we were in the middle of the rainy season, so I was able to fill my veronica bucket with the rain water. Near the end of site visit I was finally able to purchase a big water barrel at a reasonable price.

The water situation was constantly on my mind every hour of the day, so I feel like I wasn't able to fully appreciate all the other things with experiencing a new place which was unfortunate. Other highlights I was able to half experience were the fire festival, meeting all my fellow teachers, visiting the busy local market, teaching and playing sharks and minnows with the local children, and meeting the chief. I'll write about the fire festival, my school, and chieftancy in another post... eventually.

A big thing to note is the hospitality shown to me when I first arrived. I was constantly asked what I needed to feel comfortable, I was cooked meals, and I was brought fresh fruit by some of the students. In fact, my Contact Person, the person that is supposed to introduce me to the community and help me integrate, negotiated a deal for the water barrel. The first vendor we found quoted 500 cedi, but he connected me to his friend who sold me one for 250 cedi.

*The first little snack after arriving in Tamale, the Northern capitol of Ghana. This was delicious because I had no beef during homestay. Luckily, there are cows everywhere at my permanent site.*

*My primary mode of transportation around was in Hizikil's yellow yellow. I think we call them rickshaws in the US? Anyways, Hizikil messes around with the kids telling them his is a green green.*

*Waakye is a dish very common in Ghana. I ate a lot of it during site visit and there were no complaints. It's delicious.*

*It was shea fruit harvest season when we arrived and I was able to snack on them quite a bit. I've heard of shea in skin care product in the US, but was never able to try the actual fruit. They were delicious.*

![site visit jollof](/images/site_visit_jollof.png)

*I ate a lot of dafaduka (what they call jollof in the north) during site visit. It's kind of like bibimbap as you can put anything you want in it and mix. Sure there are the usual ingredients you put in it, but really it just whatever is available. Also, my community sells fried fish everywhere.*

![site visit chicken](/images/site_visit_chicken.png)

*It's customary to slaughter a chicken for a guest in Ghana, so Hizikil and I ate this guy. I was only able to eat a little of it because we had a huge meal right before eating him.*
