# Homestay
For 10 weeks of training, all the trainees live with a host family and get accustomed to Ghanaian community life. Our homestay families house us, feed us, and teach us so much during this period of integration. I’ll write about our host community in general here, and will eventually write about certain particulars such as my daily schedule, culture shocks, Ghanaian etiquette, foods, church etc.

## Thoughts
The first indication that homestay was going to be like nothing I’ve ever experienced was on the drive there. The road into Abonse, our host community, has many potholes. I swear some of the bumps could launch my head straight into the bus’s ceiling. Despite the bumpy travel, I find myself always wanting to go back when I’m elsewhere in Ghana such as in Accra or Dodowa (Peace Corps auxiliary training facility location).

Abonse is a beautiful community on a hill. Most everyone is in shape there because the hike up and down the hill alone is more than enough exercise. I sweat bullets every time I need to go up. I haven’t witnessed a sunrise yet since I'm always doing chores, but the sunsets are awesome. The views aren’t even the best part, the community is. My host family is so welcoming and helpful, and so is everyone else in Abonse.

I live at the bottom of the hill with my homestay dad (Oteng Mante), mom (Dede Sakey), eldest brother (Kwame), sister (Ama), and younger brother (Kofi). Kwame speaks really good English and he is my go to person if I need something translated to mom. He has also been teaching me how to wash clothes properly, sweep efficiently, cook, speak Twi, and speak some of the local Abonse dialect. Oh yeah, I also got a new Twi name that I'm called in the community, Yao Apenteng. Yao, because I was born on a Thursday, and Apenteng because that was my homestay mother's grandfather's name.

I also forgot to mention in my Hephzibah post, but I also got a sign name. Sign names can only be given by someone part of the deaf community. Tyler, one of the volunteers in my cohort, gave us nameless volunteers a sign name.

*Thank you Tyler for giving me and nearly everyone else in our cohort a unique sign name.*
