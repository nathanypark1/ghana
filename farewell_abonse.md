# Farewell Abonse
As I alluded to in my previous post, [End of Training](/end_of_training.md), the celebration with our homestay families was very meaningful. After leaving the ambassador's residence, we made our way to Peace Corps's Dodowa training center. Originially, we were to have the celebration in Abonse so that anyone and everyone could join, however they were in the preparatory period of the [Odwira Festival](). Since there was a restriction on loud noises and drumming, we had to move our celebration to Dodowa, thus limiting the amount of invitees. There, we said our official thank yous, performed a drumming dance, and ate with our family members.

After the celebration, we returned back to Abonse where we spent our last night with our families. The following day, our cohort parted ways and made our journeys to our communities.

## Thoughts

The entire day was bittersweet. I was ecstatic that the grueling training schedule was at an end and that I had sworn in as a Peace Corps Volunteer, but sad that I had to say goodbyes to my homestay family, my cohort, and the Peace Corps training staff. Coming from the ambassador's residence, we arrived late to Dodowa. All our homestay families were already seated and ready for the celebration to begin. Although I still feel guilty and hate being the late one to an event, punctuality in Ghana is very flexible. It's perfectly normal to wait a couple hours for a taxi to arrive. The celebration was relatively short. Our country director said a few thank yous, one of my cohort members, Dryana, read out a thank you letter in Twi, we preformed the traditional dance we practiced throughout training, and then ate Peace Corps provided food.

When we returned back to Abonse, I made sure to take pictures with everyone in Abonse that I know I'd miss. It was heartwarming to hear when the residents started asking when we'll be coming back. Likewise, it was difficult to tell them that some of us would be returning in a year, but most of us wont ever have time to come visit. I spent that last evening spending time outside with my family. I gave them some gifts I had bought: Hi-Chews and sour gummy worms I stored away from America, a Tabasco bottle I bought in Accra, and some pictures of us I had printed. Then, I went to sleep. I couldn't stay up too late because the Northerns were leaving at 6AM.

The next morning, all my family members woke up early, helped carry my luggage to the roadside, and waited patiently with me until a taxi came to pick us up. I hugged them one last time and started the journey up to the North.

*A couple days before graduation, our cohort got together and handed out superlatives. I was voted most likely to get malaria. For some reason the mosquitos love me here. My legs are scarred up from all the biting and itching.*

*Grandma Abina lived in the house next door. She housed current Peace Corps Volunteers when they came to visit Abonse and help with the training. She would always greet me in the mornings and evening.*

*Grandma Quabia lived right near the roadside about 100m away. She was very friendly ever since we first arrived in Abonse and she helped me learn a few greetings in the local dialect.*

*Doreen (directly to the right of me) and her family. Doreen was one of the very first people I met when I arrived. She was in the same grade as my homestay brother, so they would study together. Auntie Doris ran the store closest to my house. I would see her every day when I passed by.*

![farewell abonse angelina](/images/farewell_abonse/angelina.png)

*Angelina lived very close by. She would excitedly yell "Oburoni", meaning white person, when she would see me. All foreigners are considered white over here. She would run to me with a huge smile on her face, give me a high five and a fist bump, and then scurry away.*
